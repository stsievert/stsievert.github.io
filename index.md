Some software I've written:

* [salmon], a library for asking the next "best" triplet query to crowdsourcing
  participants.
* [caption-contest-data], which aggregates human responses from [The New
  Yorker's Caption Contest][tny]. Human responses are collected with the
  [voting interface][cc-vote].
* [adadamp], an implementation of a method that adapts batch size to model
  quality. This method improves the convergence of SGD.
* [swix], the Swift Matrix Library (archived).
* [jem-press], a static site generator inspired by jem-doc with Markdown and
  Mathjax.

I also wrote some code and documentation for Dask-ML's hyper-parameter
optimization:

* [Dask-ML's page on "Hyper-parameter searches"][daskml]. What problems arise in machine
  learning's hyperparameter searches, and what tools can get around those
  problems?


Other software I've written without a dedicated documentation page:

* [drawnow], a small utility to easily create animations in Python. It's a
  almost a drop-in replacement for the `drawnow` command in MATLAB.Â®
* [talks], slides for talks I've given.
* [templates]. Like how I style slides/my CV/posters/etc? This might be of
  interest.
